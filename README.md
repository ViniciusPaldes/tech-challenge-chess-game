# Tic Tac Toe Game - Tech Challenge - Vinícius Paldês

Hello, the goal of this app is to present my skills using React JS. This test was made using CoderByte, it was accomplished after around 2 hours.

## Requirement

Given a created UI for a Tic Tac Toe Game, implement the logic:

- Player selection
- Player swipe
- Avoid player to select the same tile
- Check and display the winner
- Reset a game

##  Play at

## Considerations

As the CoderByte platform give just one file everything is centralized in the index.js file. I created the npx create-react-app just to be able to run on my machine and to build using Netlify pipeline.
